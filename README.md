# Microprocessor

I've decided to post the code from my final year project here. 
It was written after I'd had a few classes on VHDL programming.
I'd done nothing on actual digital microprocessor design and had no idea about Timing Analysis or verification.
I wrote code and uploaded it onto an FPGA where I tested it manually.
Covid affected my work. I couldn't access my HOD for guidance
I ran into timining analysis for the fist time when I was trying to put everything together and just ended up maxxing the slack to allow it to run
It worked OK for my grade because the course was just about learning the basics of VHDL and I had gone beyond that and written a barely functional microprocessor.
Now my college has moved VHDL from a fifth year course to a third year one. The standard of the education is ever improving.
I'm proud to have pioneered this somewhat. Maybe I pioneer something global next time. Maybe.
